# My gaming studio website

The website that I have was based on different types of gaming studios, the gaming studios I used to inspire me were some of the ones that are recognised from around the world. I have used Atari for example which is the first gaming studio ever, Insonmiac Games, Ubisoft, Activision, Rockstar Games, Devlor Studio and EA Games.

## Description

i was given a task to build my very own website in which I could base it off of anything, Dreamweaver was used as a code builder for my website, I based it  of gaming studios and also added gifs of the gaming studios on each webpage, as well as a galleries that have images based on what the webpage is about. On each webpage i added a link image button that directed the users to the gaming studio's Instagram so that they can look at it if they wanted to, I done the same with their Youtube, on each webpage i added a YouTube video specifed to what that webpage is about so the user can see content on it and lastly I added information that the user can see and read.



## Help
I have added a webpage in which the user is able to contact me if they have any questions about the webpage or anything they would like to report, on that webpage I used validation so that the users can enter in a correct email address and not something faulty to me so it saves their and my time.
